# Wordle Game

This is a recreation of the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. In this game, players try to guess one, two, or four five-letter words depending on the level of difficulty in as few attempts as possible.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply enter a five-letter word and press enter. The game will show colored squares to indicate your progress toward the correct answer. Green squares indicate correct letters in the correct position, while yellow squares indicate correct letters in the wrong position. You have six, eight, or ten attempts respectively for each difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) to guess the word or words before you lose the game.

The game will generate a new word for you to guess each time you play. You can play as many times as you like, trying to beat your high score and improve your guessing skills. In order to play with custom words you need to provide a file named Wordle.txt and input each word in a new line.
